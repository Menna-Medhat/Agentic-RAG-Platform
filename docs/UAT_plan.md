# User Acceptance Testing Plan & Report

**Project:** Multi-Domain RAG System  
**Sprint:** 4 - Testing, Compliance, and Documentation  
**Environment:** API `https://localhost:8000`, UI `https://localhost:3001`  
**Prepared by:** Kerollos Mansour  
**Date:** June 2026

## 1. Purpose

This document defines and reports the manual user acceptance tests completed. It covers user-facing workflows, role-based access control, domain isolation, document ingestion, retrieval, answer generation, evaluation visibility, and expected error behavior.

## 2. Scope

In scope:
- Login through dev auth and Keycloak where configured.
- Domain creation, listing, member assignment, and archive/delete behavior.
- Document upload for supported formats.
- Document processing state transitions.
- Question answering with citations.
- Evaluation dashboard and quality records.
- RBAC restrictions for reader, contributor, domain_admin, and system_admin users.
- Cross-domain isolation.
- Common error handling and degraded service behavior.
- Session persistence.

## 3. Required Test Data

| Data Item | Value / Path |
|---|---|
| Admin user | `admin` (global system_admin) |
| Reader user | `viewer` (domain reader) |
| Contributor user | `contributor` (domain contributor) |
| Domain admin user | `manager` (domain domain_admin) |
| UAT domain | `UAT Test Domain` |
| Valid PDF | `tests/fixtures/sample.pdf` (Under 50 MB) |
| Valid DOCX | `tests/fixtures/sample.docx` (Placeholder) |
| Invalid file | `tests/fixtures/malicious.exe` |
| Arabic document | Arabic test text ingested |

## 4. Preconditions

- Backend gateway is running at `https://localhost:8000`.
- Frontend is running at `https://localhost:3001`.
- PostgreSQL, Redis, Qdrant storage, worker service, and evaluation service are available.
- The UAT users exist in the `users` table.

## 5. Result Rules

- **Pass:** Actual result matches the expected result.
- **Fail:** Actual result differs from expected result.
- **Blocked:** Test cannot be executed because a prerequisite is missing.
- **N/A:** Scenario does not apply (e.g. OIDC not active).

## 7. Defect Tracking

| Defect ID | Test ID | Description | Severity | Status | Resolution Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **DEF-001** | UAT-14, UAT-16 | Reader role cannot query domain because `/generate/query` attempts to fetch domain config which requires `contributor` access level or higher. | **Critical** | Closed | Resolved by relaxing domain config read access for Readers in services/domain-service/service.py. |
