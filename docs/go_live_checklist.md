## 7. Release Decision

### Known Blockers

| ID | Description | Required Fix | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **DEF-001** | Reader role unable to query own domain (config fetch permission failure). | Relax domain config read access for Readers on backend. | **Closed** (Resolved) |

### Known Non-Blocking Risks

| ID | Description | Mitigation | Accepted By |
|---|---|---|---|
| **perf-001** | p95 response time exceeds 3000 ms SLA under load. | Switch LLM route to local Ollama; scale LLM api concurrency. | Project Lead |

Do not deploy to production until every blocker is closed or explicitly accepted by the project lead.
